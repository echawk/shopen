.SH NAME
shopen \- POSIX shell implementation of xdg-open with extensions

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B shopen
{ file | url }

.SH DESCRIPTION
shopen opens a file/url in a user specified application.
shopen also implements some extensions to be more suitable
as a general purpose 'plumber'. These extensions come in
the form of being able to match a file's mimetype through
regex, and matching the given input's name through regex rules.

.SH CONFIGURATION

If using shopen just to open files, there should be no
configuration nessecary; shopen searches through all desktop
files in the system application directory and in the user's
application directory to find the proper application to
open a file in.

However, shopen cannot open urls without user configuration.
While this may seem like a downside, it was a deliberate design
decision, as it makes using shopen as a general purpose plumber
much easier and straightforward.
